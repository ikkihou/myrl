# MyRL

Welcome to **MyRL**, a Rust-based project for exploring reinforcement learning concepts and implementations.

## Features

- Written in Rust for performance and safety.
- Modular design for easy experimentation.
- Support for various RL algorithms.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/myrl.git
    cd myrl
    ```

2. Build the project:
    ```bash
    cargo build
    ```

3. Run examples:
    ```bash
    cargo run --example example_name
    ```

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following dependencies:

- [rand](https://crates.io/crates/rand): For random number generation.
- [serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde): For serialization and deserialization.
- [ndarray](https://crates.io/crates/ndarray): For numerical computations.
- [thiserror](https://crates.io/crates/thiserror): For error handling.

Make sure to check the `Cargo.toml` file for the exact versions.

## TODOs
- Implement additional RL algorithms such as DDPG and PPO.
- Add unit tests for core modules.
- Improve documentation with detailed examples and use cases.
- Optimize performance for large-scale simulations.
- Create a benchmarking suite to compare algorithm performance.
- Add support for custom environments.
- Refactor code for better readability and maintainability.
- Write a tutorial for beginners to get started with the project.
- Explore integration with visualization tools for better insights.
- Publish the project on crates.io for wider accessibility.
